### Description
Crappy Music Generator attempts to generate 10 second samples of music with a custom implementation of a variational autoencoder.

We tried to avoid using any online resources... so naturally the result isn't very pleasing to the ears.

A quick demo of what our model created can be found at `horror.wav` in our repository, warning: it is quite disturbing
